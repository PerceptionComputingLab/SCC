Code for our paper ["A Contrastive Consistency Semi-supervised Left Atrium Segmentation Model"](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0895-6111(22)00065-9). 

- Proposed a class-aware semi-supervised 3D left atrium segmentaion model.
- Proposed a contrastive consistency loss function in class-level.

The pipeline of our method is shown below:
